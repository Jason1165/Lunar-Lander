# Lunar Lander

Lunar lander but underwater and semi inspired by asciiquarium. The bottle rotates, which in hindsight is not required and also the root to my collision problems making myself do more work. 

Anyhow, use the arrow keys (left and right) to rotate and up to use up some fuel. Keep within the bounds where the sky is the limit and the floors and sides are death sentences. Avoid the shark and try landing on the castles in as close to a perfect right angle as you can.
